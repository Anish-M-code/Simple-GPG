5) Some enhancements were made , the number of iterations for hashing encryption keys were made higher for better security for symmetric file encryption and bulk encryption of individual files using aes256.

## NOTE: Like all other software this project may have bugs, though care has been taken to avoid bugs.
This mini project was done during my college 1st year to learn basics of Python Programming.
